0,"The literal meaning of philosophy is ""love of wisdom"". But this meaning does not tell us very much. Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.
Two broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.
Of what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.
There are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict.",high,10466.txt,high10466.txt,"According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?",1,"From the passage, we can conclude  _  .",2,"['Philosophy is an independent discipline.', 'Logic helps you to become a better thinker.', 'The study of philosophy brings you immediate benefits.', 'The meaning of philosophy is too limited to define.']","['not all the subjects have to do with philosophy', 'a person will get a Ph.', 'philosophy can be helpful for the study of any other subjects', 'philosophy is the only solution to all the problems to the world']",1,1,2,4,1,2,1,0.18344645431644474,0.5294517013818367,0.22228538656482694,0.0648164577368916,0.3071663148170098,0.3726022685091157,0.02939591799280746,0.5294517013818367,2,0.8568322132457421,0.011553030004540448,0.13132203301664472,0.00029272373307266116,0.7255101802290974,0.8091096176609895,0.12538511905017283,0.8568322132457421
1,"Every child has written their names on the beach at some point.
But whereas most people's ""handwriting"" is washed away, one super-rich Arab sheikh  has ensure that his graffiti  will last a little longer.
Hamad Bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, 63, has scrawled his name in sand on an island he owns with letters so big that they be seen from space.
The word ""HAMAD"" measures 1,000 meters high and is a staggering two miles long from the ""H"" to the ""D"" on the Al Futaisi Island.
And rather than allow the writing to be washed away by the ocean, the letters actually form waterways that absorb the encroaching  tide. The ruler's name is even visible on Google's map service.
Hamad dreamed up the idea and had his workmen work hard for weeks to craft the enormous piece of sand graffiti. It is not known how much it cost to make.
However, the sheikh boasts a personal fortune second to the Saudi king's.
Hamad, also known as the ""Rainbow Sheikh"", is a member of the Abu Dhabi Ruling Family.
He is understood to have some 200 cars including seven Mercedes 500 SELs painted in different colors of the rainbow which he stores in a giant pyramid.
The Arab sheikh had a taste for doing things on a large scale. He built the world's largest truck--eight times the size of the Dodge Power Wagon, with four bedrooms inside the cabin.
Hamad constructed a motor home in the shape of a giant globe which is exactly 1 millionth the size of the actual earth.
Alongside his displays of wealth he has become a well-known philanthropist  in medicine and supplied a complete Kinney stone operating theatre to a public hospital in Morocco where he continues to fund its stuff.",high,1104.txt,high1104.txt,Why does Hamad have his seven Mercedes-Benz500 SELs painted in different colors?,1,Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?,2,"['Perhaps he hoped his cars were stored in a giant pyramid safely.', 'In some ways he could make a very strange rainbow.', 'Maybe he just wanted to show off his wealth.', 'He is always interested in making his cars like these.']","[""The Rainbow Sheikh's name can be seen from space"", ""The richest Arab sheikh's name has made many funny things"", 'A great person likes doing things on a large scale', 'A well-known philanthropist displays his wealth']",1,1,2,4,1,2,1,0.13899760699324953,0.6767108455938753,0.18361675307420386,0.0006747943386714331,0.4930940925196714,0.568947794125167,0.06524336766278505,0.6767108455938753,2,0.6795744554837415,0.03894053526364757,0.0006847697541882382,0.2808002394984228,0.3987742159853187,0.5727659406449886,0.07304676231115774,0.6795744554837415
2,"Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He stopped by the fence in front of the house where he lived with his aunt Polly. He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.
He knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.
He put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea
At this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.
While Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said ""Ding-Dong-Dong"", ""Ding-Dong-Dong"" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.
Tom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: ""Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?""
No answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.
Ben said, ""Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?""
Tom turned suddenly and said, ""Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.""
""Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.""
Tom looked at the boy a bit, and said ""What do you call work?""
""Why, isn't that work?""
Tom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.
""Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.""
""Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?""
The brush continued to move.
""Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?""
Ben stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,
""Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.""
Tom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.
""No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.""
""No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little."" ""Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... ""
""Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.""
""Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...""
""I'll give you all of it.""
Tom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat --and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.
And he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.
He had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get.",high,1171.txt,high1171.txt,Why did Tom take all his bits of toys out of his pockets?,1,Which of the following is the most suitable title for this passage?,5,"['Because he is tired and wanted to play with his toys.', 'Because he wanted to throw his toys away.', 'Because he wanted to know if he could buy help with his toys.', 'Because he wanted to give his toys to his friends.']","['Tom And His Fellows', 'The Happy Whitewasher', 'Whitewashing A Fence', 'How To Make The Things Difficult To Get']",2,2,2,6,2,3,1,0.05776747216072285,0.1398523668298029,0.6416063444809608,0.16077381652851355,0.48083252795244724,0.522141792641281,0.05260067167677576,0.6416063444809608,5,0.00193330634460266,0.6004985488780884,0.3965201558179317,0.0010479889593772336,0.2039783930601567,0.46733139850411787,0.06695789428221195,0.6004985488780884
3,"In the decade of the 1970s, the United Nations organized several important meetings on the human environment to study a very serious problem.We humans are destroying the world around us.We must learn to protect them, or life will be very bad for our children and grandchildren.
There are several major aspects to this problem.
Population
Most problems of the environment come from population growth.In 1700 there were 635 million people in the world; in 1900 there were 1.6 billion; in 1950, 2.5 billion; and in 1980, 4.4 billion.In the year 2010 there will be 7.3 billion.More people need more water, more food, more wood, and more petroleum.
Distribution
Scientists say there is enough water in the world for everyone, but some countries have a lot of water and some have only a little.Some areas get all rain during one season.The rest of the year is dry.
Petroleum
We are using up the world's petroleum.We use it in our cars and to heat our buildings in winter.Farmers use petrochemicals to make the soil rich.They use them to kill insects on those plants.These chemicals go into rivers and lakes and kill the fish there.Thousands of people also die from these chemicals every year.Chemicals also go into the air and pollute it.Winds carry this polluted air to other countries and other countries.
Poverty
Poor farmers use the same land over and over.The land needs a rest so it will be better next year.However, the farmer must have food every year.Poor people cut down trees for firewood.In some areas when the trees are gone, the land becomes desert.However, people need wood to cook their food now.Poor people cannot save the environment for the future.
We now have the information and the ability to solve these huge problems.However, this is not a problem for one country or one area of the world.It is a problem for all humans.The people and the nation of the world must work together to protect the world's resources.No one controls the future, but we all help make it.",high,11813.txt,high11813.txt,Good distribution means   _  .,1,The best title of the passage should be   _,2,"['having things in the right place at the right time.', 'cutting down forests and selling them to other countries.', 'building water systems to carry water to farms.', 'conserving our natural resources']","['The World Being Destroyed', 'A Serious Problem We Should Pay Attention to', 'Aspects That Destroyed Our World', ""Conserving the World's Natural Resources""]",1,2,1,4,1,2,1,0.9764283772130486,1.90824239863742e-05,0.0009281936509059566,0.02262434671205905,0.9538040305009896,0.9685711696173982,0.17598127469966188,0.9764283772130486,2,0.0011534581857627374,0.9970136060463158,0.00103493445945332,0.0007980013084680858,0.9958601478605531,0.9960181413950878,0.18600979225067205,0.9970136060463158

I always thought people's taking pictures of their food was kind of silly, but at this new pop-up restaurant in the UK,I'd probably do it too.""The Picture House""is the world's first pay-by-photo restaurant--you order, click a photo of the food,share on Instagram and eat for free!
The restaurant belongs to frozen food giant Birds Eye,who came up with the idea to cash in on people's addiction with photographing food and sharing the pictures online. They conducted a survey and found out that more than half of the British population regularly took pictures of their meals.So they realized it was a better way to advertise their new dining range.
The pop-up diner was open in Soho,London for three days in May,and is now moving to other major UK cities.They serve two-course meals that customers don't have to pay for, if they photo and lnstagram it.
The restaurant is a part of Birds Eye's""Food for Life""campaign,a new marketing project that aims at changing the way people look at frozen food.""Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their mealtime moments--from the everyday to the special,""said marketing director Margaret Jobling.

Walk the Lewis and Clark Trail
Walk some or all of the 3,700 miles trail that was traversed by Mariwether Lewis and William Clark, two of the world's greatest explorers. Though not all the trails are marked, there are various stops that have been preserved by various historic societies. There is also a coach   that makes a 16-day _ following the trail. This begins in St. Louis, Missouri, and ends in Astoria, Oregon.
Venture Route 66
Take a tour or go to see it yourself -- ride on the famous Route 66. The road is nearly 2,500 miles long. Harley Davidson offers motorcycle tours that last two weeks. Route 66 will provide an experience that may only be found on the open road. The historic road is still well taken care of.
Visit the Grand Canyon
Visit the greatest canyon in the world, located in Northern Arizona. Raft down the Colorado River, or hike the various trails that run throughout the canyon. If walking is not your thing, there are donkey and horse riding adventures available. In addition, there are motorized boats that float down through the canyon in a week's time.
Visit Deadwood
Located in South Dakota, Deadwood is a historic landmark. It is the kind of town that comes to mind when one thinks of an old western film.

8,"Do you want to write your password down so that no one can see it, or do you want to send someone a secret message? Knowing how to make an invisible ink message will have you feeling like a secret agent in no time. These are instructions for making invisible ink using baking soda.
Difficulty: Easy
Time required: A few minutes 
What you need:
Baking soda, Paper, Water, Light bulb, Paintbrush, Measuring cup, Purple grape juice
Here's how:
There are at least two methods of using baking soda as invisible ink. Mix equal amounts of water and baking soda.
Use a paintbrush to write a message onto white paper, using the baking soda solution   as ""ink"".
Allow the ink to dry.
One way to read the message is to hold the paper up to a heat source, such as a light bulb. The baking soda will cause the writing in the paper to turn brown.
The second way to read the message is to paint over the paper with purple grape juice. The message will appear in a different color1.
Tips:

Your website is an electronic meeting place for your family, friends and potentially, millions of people around the world. Best of all, you may not have to spend a cent. The Web is filled with all kinds of free services and all it takes is some time and creativity.
       Think of your home page as the starting point of your website. Like the table of contents of a book or a magazine, the home page is the front door. Your site can have one or more pages, depending on how you design it.
       While web pages vary greatly in their design and content, most use a traditional magazine layout. At the top of the page is a banner  GRAPHIC. Next comes a greeting and a short description of the site. Pictures, texts, and links to other websites follow.
       Before you start building your site, do some planning. Think about whom the site is for and what you want to say. Next, gather up the material that you want to put on the site. Draw a rough layout on a sheet of paper.
       While there are no rules you have to follow, there are a few things to keep in mind:
       Start simply. If you are too ambitious at the beginning, you may never get the site off the ground. You can always add to your site.
Less is better. Most people don't like to read a lot of text online. Break it into small pieces.
       Smaller is better. Most people connect to the Internet with a modem. Since it can take a long time to download large image files, keep the file sizes small.
       Have the rights. Don't put any material on your site unless you are sure you can do it legally. Learn the Net's Copyright Article for more about this.

You'll grab your cell phone and open the diagnostics app.Inside your phone there will be a tiny microchip that uses X-ray waves to scan your body. The scan will reveal that your toe is just slightly hurt,not broken,which will convince you not to see a doctor.
    After breakfast,your driverless car will take you to work.While you drive,your central computer system will suggest a list of chores your housekeeping robots could see to today and it will also remind you to buy a gift for your mother's upcoming birthday.

13,"I love everything about making Easter dinner except the Saturday shopping. That day, the supermarket can be as crowded as a department store at Christmas. And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.
Trouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. ""I really don't have anybody else to ask,"" she apologized.
""Sure,"" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.
By the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.
I reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me.

15,"To a large degree, the measure of our peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment. Regardless of what happened yesterday or last year, and what may or may not happen tomorrow, the present moment is where you are -- always!
We allow past problems and future concerns to control our present moments, so much that we end up anxious, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. We often convince ourselves future will be better than today. John Lennon once said, ""Life is what's happening while we're busy making other plans. ""When we're busy making other plans"", our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away. In short, we miss out on life.
Many people live as if life were a dress rehearsal for some later date. It isn't. In fact, no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow. Now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over. When our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds. Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future--we won't have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whatever. 
To struggle against fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present. Mark Twain said, ""I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened."" I don't think I can say it any better.

17,"Recently educators have been questioning ""prep school"" (=preparatory school)   where barely literate   high school athletes get their transcripts   by taking courses occasionally and sometimes by taking no courses at all. The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.
The prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit   students who do not meet academic standard.
The prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation--at which point their grade-point averages would be written in stone--to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records.
The N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.

18,"Most people buy a lot of gifts just before Christmas. But some people think we buy too much. They have started a special day called Buy Nothing Day. They don't want anyone to go shopping on that day.
Buy Nothing Day is November 29. It's 25 days before Christmas. It's after Thanksgiving Day and often the first day of Christmas shopping. At this time, we see ads in Newspapers and on TV telling us to ""buy, buy, buy!""
The idea for Buy Nothing Day started in Vancouver, British Columbia. Now people all over the world celebrate Buy Nothing Day. In California, parents and children get together to read stories, sing songs, and paint pictures. The children talk about why they don't need a lot of toys. This year, in Manchester, England, people dressed up in costumes  to tell people that we buy too much.
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, high school students wanted to tell other students about Buy Nothing Day. They organized a spaghetti dinner to give people information about Buy Nothing Day. They asked restaurants in the neighborhood to donate  the food. They made posters and talked to other students about it. The dinner was a big success, and many students agreed not to buy anything on November 29. The students at high schools liked the idea of this new tradition.

19,"There are many acceptable varieties of English throughout the world. Whichever variety is used in your country, the most important thing is that students' pronunciation must be good enough for another person to understand what they are trying to say.
In a PPP lesson, teachers naturally include a good model of the pronunciation when they are presenting new vocabulary, grammar or functional language. It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them.
Spoken British English has 44 sounds, but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English. This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different, so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages. Also, some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages. This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly. So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds, listening to them, trying to recognize them and trying to copy them.
If you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet, this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary. You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier. However, you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet. Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right. Students need to know:
* which parts of a word are stressed (spoken louder and longer);
* which parts of a sentence are stressed;
* basic intonation patterns;
* what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence (the music of the language);
* how to link together the sounds within a sentence.
Students need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation.",high,21747.txt,high21747.txt,"Following up the passage, the author will probably   _  .",1,Which of the following is the best title for the passage?,3,"['say how to teach the phonetic alphabet', 'emphasize the importance of correct pronunciation', 'explain in detail how to practise the five suggestions', 'write about how to teach pronunciation without the phonetic alphabet']","['Suggestions on Teaching English Pronunciation.', 'Listening Comes First in Teaching Pronunciation.', 'The English Phonetic Alphabet and Pronunciation.', 'Other Things to Be Done besides Pronouncing Every Word.']",1,1,1,3,1,3,1,0.0010806904657615847,0.8570002823538007,0.1416505997951302,0.0002684273853074767,0.7153496825586705,0.8093337098050676,0.12612890408048955,0.8570002823538007,3,0.982518671596284,0.0030270157211383986,0.01422274125240236,0.0002315714301751704,0.9682959303438816,0.9766915621283787,0.17888861071339068,0.982518671596284
20,"Hair has always been an important sign of beauty, especially true for women.Next to the face, hair is one of the main qualities people look for when they consider a woman's beauty.Whether long or short, curly or straight, hair often gets a lot of attention.
Each hair grows independently of other hairs.Not all hairs experience the same period of growth at the same time.During the period of active growth, which is called Anagen, hair grows at a rate of about or one centimeter a month.About eighty five percent of hair follicles  are going through this process at any given time.This period can last from two to six years.
The Catagen period of hair growth comes next.It is then that hair growth begins to slow down.This period usually lasts two or three weeks.Finally, hair growth comes to a complete stop and the hairs begin to fall out.This period is known as Telogen.Once the Telogen period has ended, the hair growth process begins again.
So what happens when a person has trouble growing hair or suffers from hair loss? Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person.
However, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period.
Your health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice.",high,21752.txt,high21752.txt,What can be learned from the passage?,2,What is suggested by health experts when one suffers from a sudden increase in hair loss?,3,"['Hair grows no more after the Telogen period.', 'One with shoulder length hair must grow more hair.', 'Hair growth has much to do with nutrition and health.', 'Only a few hair follicles go through the Anagen period.']","['Changing his genes.', 'Going to see a doctor.', 'Cutting all his hair off.', 'Eating more vegetables.']",1,1,1,3,1,3,2,0.0033248920022611412,0.0005884529199103638,0.995846410183272,0.00024024489455631279,0.9925215181810109,0.9944618802443628,0.18543038289404618,0.995846410183272,3,0.6841715357771022,0.18861140575453475,0.10575985479788183,0.021457203670481092,0.4955601300225675,0.5788953810361364,0.0663276278061315,0.6841715357771022
21,"NEW ORLEANS --A two-story, 1,500-ton and 16,000-square foot school built in 1879 is being moved about 300 yards to make way for the new University Medical Center in MidCity.
The school' s relocation is marked as the largest structure ever to be moved in Louisiana and one of the top-ten heaviest in America.Officials originally had planned to  _ the McDonogh No.11 School, but agreed to move the historic building at the city's request.
The school is being moved on a platform of steel beams put under the schoolhouse floor, then set on 38 remote-controlled power dollies made mobile by 300 tires.The school is creeping forward on a short stay that will take about two days to move it about 300 yards.
State officials said the operation shows how closely the state and city leaders are working topreserve history.
"" We' re looking to the future and building for the future, and building something new.We're also honoring the past and trying to save something historic,"" said Michael Diresto with the Division of Administration for the state of Louisiana.
Christian Cancienne, president and CEO of Orleans Shoring, said the feat of this endeavor is something a person rarely sees.
""When we heard about the opportunity to move a building this size, we knew that there was never a building moved this size in the state of Louisiana,"" he said.""We knew that because of the oak trees and neutral ground and the narrow streets, we may never get the opportunity in our hometown again to do something like this.
Cancienne said the cost of the huge project weighs in at $350,000, but he' s not making any profit from the move.Cancienne said his team wanted to do the project for free because of the once in a lifetime opportunity.""When my guys heard that this opportunity was here, they said, 'Let' s do it for free.We got to get it.No one else can do it.' And, so, we said let's just cover our cost so we bid it at $ 350,000.""

23,"Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.
""All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'"" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. ""There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.""
    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.
Now, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of ""naming structures"", ""brand architecture"" and ""identity systems"", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words ""theNewSchool"".
    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.
    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and ""morning zoo"" radio shows.
Many college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results.

24,"Why do people cross their fingers when facing difficulties-eve non-religious people? Why do we blame the black cat when we saw the low score of the test?
These habits have been referred to as magical thinking and can be found everywhere in daily life. For example, a person wishes something bad for an annoying colleague. Or parents pray for a safe fight when seeing their son off. 
Psychologically helpful
In examining these habits, scientists decided to search for a reason for humans' belief in magical powers. Psychologists have their own approach to the question. 
""I think in part it's because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts, and thus likely to overestimate their connection to outside events. ""said Emily Pronin, a psychologist in the prefix = st1 /US.
For people who are uncertain of their own abilities or slow to take action, magical thinking can be a great help, explained Dr. Daniel Wegner, a professor psychology at Harvard. Feeling that their own thoughts can control things can help people fight depression. 
A trait gained through evolution
But evolutionists have their own ideas. 
Two schools of evolutionary thought have come up with reasons by analyzing the development of humans. They are the ""adaptationists ""and the ""byproduct theorists "". 
The adaptationists say that belief in magical powers makes people feel better, less worried about difficulties, more focused on the future, and more willing to care for themselves. People with a strong faith (in something) have a better chance of surviving a tough environment or competition. 
But in byproduct theory,magical thinking is a product of our psychological features. 
""We automatically look for an explanation of why things happen,""explains Justin Barrett, a psychologist, The brain, therefore, has evolved to make quick judgments about causation . So we often link two events based on nothing more than coincidence. For example, ""I was just thinking about looking up my old high school girlfriend when she suddenly called me. ""
Another psychological feature is the theory of mind. We recognize that there could be an unseen power of mind affecting the outcome of an incident. 
Byproduct theorists claim that because of these features, we are born with a tendency to believe in our magical thinking. 
But we need to confine our magical thinking, warn psychologists. 
For most people, beliefs are just some sort of comforting private ritual.

In your last letter, you told me that your boss Stephanie was probably looking for a new job and you didn't know how to tell her that you wanted to take her position if she left. Well, I'd like to tell you that there is no polite way to talk about this situation with your boss. After all, you are not one-hundred-percent sure that she is actually job-hunting. Even if you know for sure that she is, you can't, because it's not your business. Still, there are a couple of things that you can do to put yourself in a good position in case your boss does _ in the near future.
First, you can have a general conversation with her about your career plans. Say something like, ""You've always been supportive of me, Stephanie, and I'd love you to give me some advice on my professional development."" This will let your boss know that you're ready for a new challenge. Ask her to give you feedback about how she thinks you can improve as a future leader.
Second, ask for your manager's approval   to talk with the training department about any program the company offers. There may or may not be any training, but making the request will still communicate your desire to get into a people-management role.
Third, you could say to your boss, ""If there is anything you need my help with, I'd love it if you let me know. I am very interested in supporting you with anything you want to hand off.""
Taking those three steps will make it clear to Stephanie that you're ready to be her No. 2.

27,"Long after the 1998 World Cup was won, disappointed fans were still cursing the disputed refereeing decisions that denied victory to their team. A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.
The researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.
Observers noted down the referees' errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.
The researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the action. The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters. The research shows the optimum   distance is about 20 meters.
There also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.
If FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.
He also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided. If keeping up with the action is not so important, their physical condition is less critical.",high,3864.txt,high3864.txt,The number of refereeing errors in the experimental matches was   _  .,1,"The word ""officials"" (Para. 4) most probably refers to   _  .",3,"['slightly above average', 'higher than in the 1998 World Cup', 'quite unexpected', 'as high as in a standard match']","['the researchers involved in the experiment', 'the inspectors of the football tournament', 'the referees of the football tournament', 'the observers at the site of the experiment']",1,1,2,4,1,2,1,0.3978668298154413,0.1892521815511216,0.3356671098695843,0.07721387876385287,0.06219971994585699,0.19715577308725507,0.015687198552801634,0.3978668298154413,3,0.002880155241027466,0.04587237158894481,0.9475555887588668,0.0036918844111607204,0.901683217169922,0.9300741183451557,0.16249694839201873,0.9475555887588668
28,"In 1947 a group of famous people from the art world headed by an Austrian conductor decided to hold an intemational festival of music,dance and theatre in Edinburgh. The idea was to reunite Europe after the Second World War.
At the same time, the ""Fringe"" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years.
Soon,groups of studentsfirstly from Edinburgh University, and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by little-known writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh.
Today the ""Fringe"",once less recognized, has far outgrown the festival with around 1,500 performances of theatre,music and dance on every one of the 21 days it lasts. And yet as early as 1959,with only 19 theatre groups performing,some said it was getting too big.
A paid administrator was first employed only in 1971, and today there are eight administrators working all year round and the number rises to 150 during August itself.

29,"I have only once been in trouble with the law.The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent   fate in court.
It happened in February about twelve years ago.I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October.I was still living at home at the time.
One morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived.I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling.As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me.It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.
It was about half past eleven when it happened.I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me.I thought he was going to ask me the time.Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me.At first I thought it was some kind of joke
But then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.
'But what for?"" I asked
'Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,' he said.
'What offence?' I asked
'Theft,' he said
'Theft of what?'I asked
'Milk bottles,' he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!
'Oh,' I said.
It turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.
Then I made my big mistake.At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as pan of the sixties' 'youth counterculture'.As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, 'How long have you been following me?  in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage.I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable   character.
A few minutes later a police car arrived.
'Get in the back,' they said.'Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.'
They got in on either side of me.It wasn't funny any more.
At the police station they questioned me for several hours.I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation.When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job.'Aha,' I could see them thinking, 'unemployed'.
Eventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday.Then they let me go.
I wanted to conduct my own defense in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor  .We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness.But he was never called on to give evidence.My 'trial' didn't get that far.The magistrate   dismissed the case after fifteen minutes.1 was free.The poor police had never stood a chance.The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police.
And so I do not have a criminal record.But what was most shocking at the time was the things my release from the charge so clearly depended on.I had the 'right' accent, respectable middle-class parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor.Given the obscure nature of the charge.I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is every chance that I would have been found guilty.While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously revolved   around the fact that I had a 'brilliant academic record'.
Meanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was gloomily complaining to my mother that another youngster had been turned against the police. 'You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,' he said to me reproachfully  .
What did he mean? Probably that I should have looked outraged  and said something like, 'Look here, do you know who you're talking to? I am a highly successful student with a brilliant academic record.How dare you arrest me!' Then they, probably, would have apologized perhaps even taken off their caps, and let me on my way.",high,4425.txt,high4425.txt,The first man who came up to him was   _  .,0,"In the opinion of one of the policeman who had arrested the author, the whole thing might not have occurred if   _  .",3,"['a uniformed policeman', 'a policeman in plainclothes', 'not a policeman', 'a good joker']","['he had protested strongly at the time', 'he had begged to be allowed to go home', ""he hadn't wandered aimlessly"", 'he had tried to look cool']",1,2,2,5,2,2,0,0.09505420584099698,0.16616465289561888,0.7303337296854053,0.008447411577978708,0.5641690767897865,0.6404449729138738,0.08002617734963666,0.7303337296854053,3,0.07482338219436799,0.020862138619103486,0.8691120925378021,0.0352023866487266,0.7942887103434341,0.8254827900504027,0.12815720119299265,0.8691120925378021
30,"The Queen's English is now sounding less upper-class, a scientific study of the Queen's Christmas broadcasts has found. Researchers have studied each of her messages to the Commonwealth countries since 1952 to find out the change in her pronunciation from the noble Upper Received to the Standard Received.
Jonathan Harrington, a professor at Germany's University of Munich, wanted to discover whether accent changes recorded over the past half century would take place within one person. ""As far as I know, there just is nobody else for whom there is this sort of broadcast records,"" he said.
He said the noble way of pronouncing vowels  had gradually lost ground as the noble upper-class accent over the past years. ""Her accent sounds slightly less noble than it did 50 years ago. But these are very, very small and slow changes that we don't notice from year to year.""
""We may be able to relate it to changes in the social classes,"" he told The Daily Telegraph, a British  newspaper. ""In 1952 she would have been heard saying 'thet men in the bleck het'. Now it would be 'that man in the black hat'. Similarly, she would have spoken of 'the citay' and'dutay', rather than 'citee' and 'dutee', and 'hame' rather than 'home'. In the 1950s she would have been 'lorst', but by the 1970s 'lost'.""

31,"John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.
His interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.
During the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.
When the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. ""You'll recognize me,"" she wrote, ""by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel."" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.
I'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. ""Going my way , sailor?"" she murmured.
Almost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.
And there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.
This would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  ""I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?""
The woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. ""I don't know what this is about, son,"" she answered, ""but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!""
It's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive.

32,"There has been much discussion recently about reducing the weight of English in China's high-stake tests such as the national college entrance examination. It is argued by some applauding the recent change to reduce the importance of English in tests so that it will lead students to focus more on learning Chinese. The TV program Writing in Chinese has exposed the problem that students and the general public cannot write in Chinese as they used to do.
Some blame the design of the curriculum for giving English an equal or greater amount of emphasis, which might have contributed to the failure in teaching Chinese. But this is probably not a fair accusation since children in English speaking countries cannot spell either.
I doubt that studying English in itself hurts the study of Chinese. In fact, high achievers in English or another foreign language are more likely to be high achievers in Chinese. It has been proved many times in recent Chinese history that those capable of using a foreign language are also masters in their mother tongue. Qian Zhongshu, Lu Xun and Lin Yutang are just a few examples.
Another trend of thought for curriculum reform is related to the perception of ""worth"". It is true that English is one of the subjects that students do spend too much time on, with pitiful results. This makes some doubt if it is worth giving it priority. But this is not a sound argument either as students still need to study things that matter more to their future in spite of challenges learning English presents to them.
Improvements in Chinese language education should not be achieved by sacrificing another important subject. There should be a robust  foreign language education program, as a foreign language improves a student's future job prospects. Bashing  English education as a waste of time or using it as a goat for failures in Chinese education are both harmful tendencies.
To be constructive, we ought to start a dialogue on ways to make improvements in learning outcomes so that students' time learning English is spent more effectively. There are a few things that could improve English education, such as assessment design,learner motivation and teaching style,
I am sure there are many other areas where changes can greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of English learning. The public discourse at present is a little oversimplified. People are arguing for or against English having less weight in major tests, when the dialogue should be taken a step further, to the improvement of learning or teaching methods that may benefit the teaching of other subjects as well, Chinese included.",high,6129.txt,high6129.txt,"According to the passage, which of the following statements is right?",0,Which of the following can best serve as the title of the passage?,2,"['The TV program Writing in Chinese is very popular at present.', 'Good results of learning English are not worth so much time.', 'Some are in favor of attaching less importance to English in exams.', 'Sacrificing English can improve Chinese language education.']","['English education is still important in China.', 'Chinese education is more important in China.', 'English contributes to the failure in teaching Chinese', 'Ways to make improvements in learning Chinese.']",2,2,2,6,2,3,0,0.0007931123853019272,0.0014788944883768278,0.9947489725188362,0.0029790206074850768,0.9917699519113511,0.9929986300251149,0.1848843022618059,0.9947489725188362,2,0.934186182530762,0.03344172577348574,0.02678829528331985,0.0055837964124325675,0.9007444567572763,0.9122482433743493,0.15614274105016726,0.934186182530762
33,"Researchers in the psychology department at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have discovered a major difference in the way men and women respond to stress. This difference may explain why men are more likely to suffer from stress-related disorders.
Until now, psychological research has maintained that both men and women have the same ""fight-or-flight"" reaction to stress. In other words, individuals either react with aggressive behavior, such as verbal or physical conflict (""fight""), or they react by withdrawing from the stressful situation (""flight""). However, the UCLA research team found that men and women have quite different biological and behavioral responses to stress. While men often react to stress in the fight-or-flight response, women often have another kind of reaction which could be called ""tend and befriend."" That is, they often react to stressful conditions by protecting and nurturing their young (""tend""), and by looking for social contact and support from others - especially other females ('befriend"").
Scientists have long known that in the fight-or- flight reaction to stress, an important role is played by certain hormones  released by the body. The UCLA research team suggests that the female tend-or-befriend response is also based on a hormone. This hormone, called oxytocin, has been studied in the context of childbirth, but now it is being studied for its role in the response of both men and women to stress. The principal investigator, Dr. Shelley E. Taylor, explained that ""animals and people with high levels of oxytocin are calmer, more relaxed, more  social, and less anxious."" While men also secrete oxytocin, its effects are reduced by male hormones.
In terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed. They may phone relatives or friends, or ask directions if they are lost.
The study also showed how fathers and mothers responded differently when they came home to their family after a stressful day at work. The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet. For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.
The differences in responding to stress may explain the fact that women have lower frequency of stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure or aggressive behavior. The tend-and-befriend regulatory  system may protect women against stress, and this may explain why women on average live longer than men.",high,6512.txt,high6512.txt,What can be learned from the passage?,2,Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?,3,"[""Male hormones help build up the body's resistance to stress."", 'In a family a mother cares more about children than a father does.', 'Biological differences lead to different behavioral responses to stress.', 'The UCLA study was designed to confirm previous research findings.']","['How men and women get over stress', 'How men and women suffer from stress', 'How researchers overcome stress problems', 'How researchers handle stress-related disorders']",1,1,2,4,1,2,2,0.019183520200675264,0.0017354377739769989,0.9747133365502276,0.004367705475120186,0.9555298163495524,0.9662844487336368,0.17511404612288792,0.9747133365502276,3,0.1260453943014064,0.8711750112749028,0.000616625105852537,0.0021629693178382317,0.7451296169734964,0.8282333483665371,0.1312096000893038,0.8711750112749028
34,"Here is some must-know information from a handbook on how people behave in doing business in some countries.
In Brazil 
Brazilians are warm and friendly.They often stand close when talking and it is common for them to touch the person on the shoulder.People often greet each other (particularly women)with light cheek kisses . Schedules tend to be flexible,with business meetings sometimes starting later than planned.But to be safe,be on time.Meals can stretch for hours--there's no such thing as rushing a meal in Brazil.Lunches also can start in the mid to late afternoon.Brazilians are social,preferring face-to-face communication over emails or phone calls.
In Singapore
Singaporeans shake hands when they meet and often also greet each other with a small,polite bow.Business cards should be offered and received with two hands.Arriving late is considered disrespectful.So be on time.Efficiency is the goal,so meetings and dealings often are fast-paced.Singaporeans are direct in their discussions,even when the subject is about money.Rank is important and authority is respected.This determines how people interact in meetings.For example,people avoid disagreeing outright with someone of a higher rank.

35,"For the first time in Hong Kong's history, an entertainer has been written into middle school textbooks. He is considered one of the best actors in Hong Kong. Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat.
The example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed.
On hearing about this, Chow said happily, ""I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.""
Indeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life.
Chow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including ""Shanghai Bund""(<<>> ) and ""A Better Tomorrow"". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.
In 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world. In 1998, the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as ""Chow Yun-fat Day"".",high,785.txt,high785.txt,Chow felt   _   when he learned that he had been written into middle school textbooks.,1,What can we infer from the passage?,2,"['surprised', 'shy', 'sad', 'happy']","['Chow Yun-fat is proud of his success.', 'Chow Yun-fat prefers to make a living by selling cameras rather than by performing.', 'Chow Yun-fat has won more awards than other actors.', 'Chow Yun-fat is popular both at home and abroad.']",2,2,2,6,2,3,1,0.3105815643521302,0.00028769281156092,0.0009974853017426222,0.6881332575345663,0.37755169318243614,0.5841776767127551,0.07999734149615778,0.6881332575345663,2,0.2616449517282896,0.0014500886258963222,0.00034366989588411717,0.7365612897499301,0.47491633802164046,0.6487483863332401,0.09024570879724991,0.7365612897499301
36,"Throughout the world, clothing has many uses. It is used to provide protection from cold. It is also worn to prevent others from seeing specific parts of one's body. However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.
People in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status , intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender .
Long before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.
Putting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English ""punks"" are essential aspects of their uniforms.
There are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing - deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive.",high,8631.txt,high8631.txt,"According to the passage, the behavior of others towards you can be changed by your  _  .",3,"From the passage, it can be inferred that  _  .",4,"['age', 'dress', 'status', 'gender']","['clothing plays an important role in social activities', 'words of dress are unable to communicate different messages', 'dress is better than language in communicating messages', 'messages communicated by clothes are the same in different cultures']",2,2,2,6,2,3,3,0.13735354439418984,0.5341796936880697,0.12152118560320815,0.2069455763145324,0.32723411737353736,0.3789062582507595,0.027951952853222484,0.5341796936880697,4,0.997547666254352,3.3663254749977143e-06,4.10099131509034e-05,0.002407957507022091,0.9951397087473299,0.9967302216724693,0.1862767866005012,0.997547666254352
37,"Over the years, Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, has studied such things as how far Americans typically drive to buy food, how many times we refill our plates at all-you-can-eat buffets and how we organize our kitchens. In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase ""mindless eating""(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.
His new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:
Keep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, ""women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.""
Trick yourself into drinking less wine. ""We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses."" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: ""Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.""
Wansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a ""free"" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.
The point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less.",high,8989.txt,high8989.txt,"According to Wansink, which of the following affects the amount of wine we drink:   _  .",1,What's the main idea of the passage?,2,"['the shape of wineglasses', 'the color of wineglasses', 'the taste of wine', 'the quality of wine']","['Changing environment or habits of eating will help you eat less.', 'Eating fruits and vegetables is better for your health.', 'Keeping your kitchen counter clear of any food will help make you thin.', 'Many people eat or drink too much without paying attention to it.']",2,2,2,6,2,3,1,0.2860895014597866,0.23694595477883834,0.2459871045122908,0.2309774392490843,0.040102396947495816,0.048119335279715486,0.0004627053399924075,0.2860895014597866,2,0.3449019960109029,0.002224890569001679,0.0923427991836577,0.5605303142364378,0.21562831822553497,0.4140404189819171,0.04792094068235549,0.5605303142364378
38,"Throughout July 1945, the Japanese mainland, from Tokyo on Honshu northward to the coast of Hokkaido, were bombed as if an invasion were about to take place. In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. 
In 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.
On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others.

39,"Individuality is the particular character, or aggregate (total) of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others. Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed  .
Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.
First, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.
Her second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.
Her third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.
She was as exciting and eccentric   in her personal life as in her dance.",high,9122.txt,high9122.txt,"According to the passage, what did nature represent to Isadora Duncan?",0,Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?,4,"['Something to conquer.', 'A model for movement.', 'A place to find peace.', 'A symbol of disorder.']","['Artists of the Last Century', 'Evolution of Dance in the 20th Century', 'Natural Movement in Dance', 'A Pioneer in Modern Dance']",2,2,1,5,2,2,0,0.004300125573203883,0.9770630865994588,0.00828022008406102,0.01035656774327622,0.9667065188561826,0.9694174487992785,0.1762116467038171,0.9770630865994588,4,3.122409189679778e-05,0.034897393987655886,0.00311554280414988,0.9619558391162972,0.9270584451286413,0.949274452155063,0.16914664302474441,0.9619558391162972

The school calls the new way of learning ""Tuantuanzuo"", meaning sitting in groups. Wei Liying, a Junior 3 teacher, said it was to give students more chances to communicate.
Each group has five or six students, according to Wei, and they play different roles .There is a team leader who takes care of the whole group.

45,"Raising pets is a popular online game among teenagers. ""More than 20 of my classmates have adopted pets online, while last year the number was just 10,"" said Wang Hui,a middle school student from Beijing, who also raises pets online.
If you go to some websites, you can adopt virtual pets like penguins, chickens, dogs and elephants. You can feed,wash, talk to and play with your pet.
Dai Yingshuang of Shanghai raises pets on KaixinOOl. com. The 15-year-old girl said it is great fun. She thinks that she has also learned how to take care of others.
If one doesn't feed and care for the pet, it becomes unhappy and unhealthy. So raising an online pet means spending a lot of time online.
This makes many parents worried. They fear there will be bad influence in the children's studies.
Dai said that she usually asks her uncle to take care of her pet, while she is at school.
Wang Zhaotong, from Anhui,has been raising a penguin on QQ. com since last year. The 14-year-old girl takes good care of the penguin.
She said her parents knew about the penguin and think it's Okay. If the students can keep the balance between studying and playing, it's not bad for them to ""raise"" pets online.

50,"Walking is a popular form of exercise. It is an easy activity and offers a good way to improve physical fitness. Walking also gives many of the same benefits as other kinds of exercise.
Regular, brisk walks help a person's body work better. Walking builds a stronger heart and lungs. Walking also seems to help protect the heart from heart disease. The lungs work better because they take in and use oxygen more effectively. Walking can help in weight control, too. A quick fifteen-minute walk burns as many calories as jogging the same distance in half the time. Walking causes very injuries, so there is also a lower ""dropout"" rate among walkers than among runners.
People are more likely to continue a walking program. This gives a better chance for success. Walking offers some mental benefits, too. It seems to make people feel better. Many walkers say they sleep better at night when they take regular walks. Others say they have a better attitude towards life. Walking offers many of the same physical and mental benefits as other forms of exercise, but walking offers some special advantages, too. Almost everyone can walk. There are no special lessons or training. To become a real walker, a person only needs to walk faster, farther, and more often.
People can walk almost anywhere. There are no special playing fields or courts for walking. Sidewalks, streets, parks, fields, and malls are excellent places for walking. People can walk almost anytime. A person doesn't need a team or a partner for walking. There is no ""season"" for walking. Most walkers walk in all kinds of weather.
Walking doesn't cost anything. There are no special fees for walking. Good walking shoes and comfortable clothes are the only equipment that a walker needs.

Dear Lin Tao,
I am writing to you in English. I hope you can understand  it.
I love studying in London and I have many new friends. Most of them are my classmates. From Monday to Friday, we have English, math, physics and P. E. in the morning. I like English and physics, because they're interesting. I don't like math. It's too boring. At noon, I have to have lunch at school because my home is far from my school. We usually have two classes in the afternoon--art and politics. We finish our classes at 3:30 p. m. After school, my friends and I always play football on the playground. And then we go home by bus.
On weekends, we have no classes. We often go to the park and sometimes we go to the movies in the evening. We see movies twice a month. I like some famous  actors like Jackie Chan.
Oh, I have no time to write more. Please write back soon.
Best wishes,
Wang Gang

56,"On a stormy day last August, Tim heard someone shouting. Looking at the sea carefully, he saw that two kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.
Two 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, had rowed out in a boat to _ a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The boys were terrified and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.
Tim knew that it would soon be swallowed by the waves.
""Everything went quiet in my head,"" Tim recalls. ""I'm trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.""
Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. ""At one point, I considered turning back,"" he says. ""I wondered if I was putting my life at risk."" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to shout to the boys, ""Take down the umbrella!""
""Let's aim for the pier ,"" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. ""Can you swim?"" he cried. ""A little bit,"" the boys said.
Once they were in the water, Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces.
""Are we almost there?"" they asked again and again. ""Yes,"" Tim told them each time.
After 30 minutes, they reached the pier.

59,"Hunan TV's new program,   Dad,Where Are We Going? has become very popular since last year. The show tells us that fathers should take part in their children's growing-up. In fact, this topic was always mentioned by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872). a famous official during the late Daoguang Period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).
Although Zeng spent most of his time away from his family, his letters back home to his children and younger brothers have become famous. In these letters, there are many helpful suggestions on proper behavior . Many of his ways on child education are popular among today's Chinese parents, including reading classical books and so on. His child-raising methods are useful for today's busy fathers. Like Zeng, they also spend most of their time away from home.
According to Zeng,  the purpose of education was to learn wisdom from books, rather than getting an official position. Children should know that the most important purpose of studies is to get more knowledge about nature and life.
""But now ,parents just want their children to be rich and powerful. "" Mr. Tang, a writer in China, said.
Some teachers say that parents need to build a good relationship with their children. Parents shouldn't force  their children to realize their wishes.

65,"One thing that British and Chinese cultures share is a love for fine tea. Today, when we think of western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china cups.
Afternoon tea
People believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English are only two main meals each day ----breakfast and a heavy dinner that would last several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o`clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important,  fine china cups and plates, and silver teapots, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in the modern Britain.
Will you come for coffee?
Coffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use the words ""Will you come for coffee?"" to mean ""Would you like to come to my home for a chat?""Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a ""coffee"" party.
Coffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange 
In the 17thcentury London, coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to have started from these coffeehouses.

67,"Do you obey the rules in your school? What do you think of your school rules? Are you allowed to dye   hair? A lot of school rules are similar around the world, but some are different. Some students may enjoy more freedom in some countries. But freedom doesn't mean ""no rules"". Every school has its own rules.
There are some rules in Japanese schools. The students are not allowed to dye their hair and are supposed to keep their hair black. They are not allowed to wear earrings either. Almost all schools used to require students to wear school uniforms but now half of the schools require uniforms. The students feel happy to wear all kinds of clothes. The students must get to school on time. If they are late, they cannot get into the school because the school gate is closed. In Japan, students are not allowed to have part-time jobs.
American schools have their own rules too. For example, at Morton High School, students are not allowed to choose their own clothes. They must get to school or leave school on time. Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom. They must wear sports shoes in PE class. They are supposed to keep quiet on the school bus.

Time proved  that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears. He got on well with his classmates. But one day, he said to his mother, tears in his eyes, ""A big boy called me a freak  .""
The boy's father asked the family doctor. ""Could nothing be done?""
""I believe I could graft   on a pair of outer ears if they could be got,"" the doctor said. They tried to find a person who was helpful for the young man.
One day, his father said to the son, ""You're going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But we must keep it a secret who the person is.""
The operation  was a great success, and a new person appeared. His cleverness and hard work made him a very successful person. He married and lived a happy life.
He once asked his father, ""Who gave me the ears? I could do enough for him or her.""
""I do not believe you could, ""said the father."" The agreement was that you are not to know...not yet.""
For years they kept it a secret, but the day did come. He stood with his father over his mother's body. Slowly, the father raised the thick, brown hair. To his surprise, the son found his mother had no outer ears.

74,"Robots are supposed to run on batteries, right? Well not all of them.
Scientists in England have built a kind of small robots that get their energy from dead flies, bad apples, or sugar.
One robot, called Slugbot, was even designed to hunt  garden slugs for dinner!
What's up with all that food?
Well, scientists at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory want to invent robots that can operate for a long time in dark, dirty, or dangerous places.
Many of those spots, like the seafloor or Antarctica, don't have electrical sockets .
So inventor Chris Melhuish came up with a better idea: Build robots that get their energy just like animals do by hunting and eating food from their environment.
One robot, called Ecobot II, could run for 12 days on a diet of eight flies! Of course, it'd still get a lot more power from one AA battery, though.
Melhuish says his team is now working on a new and improved robot, called Ecobot III, which will have a better digestion system.
It seems that after an eight fly dinner, Ecobot II couldn't deal with the leftover  ""waste"".
